## bio
**Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience in the industrial sector.**


Data science professional with a software engineering background, working on enhancing the efficiency and profitability of industrial operations. Specializes in developing and implementing end-to-end machine learning and artificial intelligence systems for process optimization. Proficient in communicating data-driven insights and recommendations to stakeholders and clients. Collaborates with international colleagues on various projects, delivering high-quality results and solutions.

I have a proven track record of using data science and software engineering to improve the efficiency and profitability of mining operations. Here are some of the highlights of my projects:

- Developed clustering-based system that classify unsupervised data in real time to allow adaptability in preexisting control systems, helping the operation reduce variability and maximize profitability,
- Successfully implemented state-of-the-art algorithms to detect real-time oscillations and perform corrective actions in control systems,
- Continously perform data-driven statistical analysis to understand complex scenarios, craft precise visualizations, and tell data stories to communicate the insights to key stakeholders from different levels.
